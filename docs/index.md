## Chapter Overview

| Chapter | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | [Hello World](chapters/01-hello-world.md) | Compilation, basic syntax, printf |
| 2 | [Types and Variables](chapters/02-types-variables.md) | Static typing, primitive types, sizeof |
| 3 | [Control Flow](chapters/03-control-flow.md) | if/else, loops, switch |
| 4 | [Functions](chapters/04-functions.md) | Prototypes, pass by value |
| 5 | [Arrays and Strings](chapters/05-arrays-strings.md) | Fixed arrays, null-terminated strings |
| 6 | [Pointers](chapters/06-pointers.md) | Memory addresses, dereferencing |
| 7 | [Memory Management](chapters/07-memory.md) | Stack vs heap, malloc/free |
| 8 | [Structs](chapters/08-structs.md) | Custom data types, typedef |
| 9 | [File I/O](chapters/09-file-io.md) | Reading/writing files |
| 10 | [Building Programs](chapters/10-building-programs.md) | Headers, multi-file projects, Make |

## Prerequisites

- **Python experience**: You should be comfortable with Python basics (variables, loops, functions, classes)
- **Command line familiarity**: Basic terminal/shell usage
- **A C compiler**: See the [Setup Guide](getting-started/setup.md)

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Read the comparisons**: Each concept is shown in both Python and C
2. **Type the code**: Don't just read—type and run the examples
3. **Do the exercises**: They're designed to leverage your Python knowledge
4. **Make mistakes**: Segfaults and compiler errors are your teachers in C

!!! tip "The Best Way to Learn"
    Try converting small Python scripts you've written to C. Start simple and gradually tackle more complex programs.
